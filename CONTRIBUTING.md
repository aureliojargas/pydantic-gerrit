# Contributing to this repository

Please, not yet. This is still vapourware.

## Guidelines

- We target only the currently supported Python versions: <https://devguide.python.org/versions/>

- Keep dependencies to a minimum. This project should be easily importable by other projects.

- Keep the models alphabetically ordered within each endpoint, for consistency.
