# Dev notes

## TODO - schemas

- Complete all entities generation
- Fix generated Python code to import from other generated models instead of creating those empty types/classes
- Define testing strategy
  - Have JSON input/responses saved in the repo?
    - Then the models can be validated against them
    - No need for a Gerrit instance to run the tests
      - This is important so the tests run fast and reliably
    - Gerrit instance would be useful to generate the JSON files
    - Different sets of files per Gerrit version

- Docs:
  - How to regenerate the models: `cd schemas/v3_12 && python ../../scripts/generate.py --version 3_12`


## TODO

- Maybe try converting `polygerrit-ui/app/types/common.ts` directly to Pydantic?
  - `polygerrit-ui/app/api/rest-api.ts`
  - `polygerrit-ui/app/constants/constants.ts`
  - `polygerrit-ui/app/types/types.ts`
  - First commit adding it in Jul 2020: bfbd275a1bd17c038b5905a34f4863a446f3914e
  - How far it goes back?
    - Was it a good support back then?
    - Can I rely on it to generating everything?
    - Or should I stick to what it supports?
  - Study it more.
  - Is it official and well maintained?
  - Everything in a single file is an advantage?
  - Does it change too much?
  - My differential:
    - Support multiple versions (well, that one already does, via stable branches)
    - Python
    - Automatic testing
      - does this one also have it?
      - Investigate
    - detached from Gerrit, anyone can install
  - It has some niceties such as enum and base classes

    ```ts
    export type GroupAuditEventInfo =
    | GroupAuditAccountEventInfo
    | GroupAuditGroupEventInfo;

    export enum GroupAuditEventType {
    ADD_USER = 'ADD_USER',
    REMOVE_USER = 'REMOVE_USER',
    ADD_GROUP = 'ADD_GROUP',
    REMOVE_GROUP = 'REMOVE_GROUP',
    }

    export interface GroupAuditEventInfoBase {
    user: AccountInfo;
    date: Timestamp;
    }

    export interface GroupAuditAccountEventInfo extends GroupAuditEventInfoBase {
    type: GroupAuditEventType.ADD_USER | GroupAuditEventType.REMOVE_USER;
    member: AccountInfo;
    }

    export interface GroupAuditGroupEventInfo extends GroupAuditEventInfoBase {
    type: GroupAuditEventType.ADD_GROUP | GroupAuditEventType.REMOVE_GROUP;
    member: GroupInfo;
    }
    ```

- Tests cover all models from `groups` (run `make uncovered`)
- Document the decisions: Python version, Gerrit versions, no patch-level versions in the models, no EOL'ed versions, etc.
- How to automate the API usage without manually generating an HTTP password first?

## Models

- Use `extra='forbid'` in all models? Makes sense, since we're targeting specific API versions.

- Should I add extra models making non-optional the fields affected by extra query options? For example, activating `members` and `includes` fields in `GroupInfo`, we could have extra models such as `GroupInfoPlusMembers` and `GroupInfoPlusIncludes`, and the combination of both: `GroupInfoPlusMembersAndIncludes`. This combination can explode the number of models if many extra fields are activated.
  - The models that use `GroupInfo` as an attribute type may also be affected by `o=MEMBERS`, for example?

## Input models

Testing input models is convoluted because:

> <https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/rest-api.html#input>
>
> Unknown JSON parameters will simply be ignored by Gerrit without causing an exception.

So if I really want to make sure the input models only contains valid fields, I would have to always assert that the informed value was set in the just-created element. I don't want to go down that route. At least not now.

Some fields in the input models have leading underscores. Pydantic considers them private.
We're using `alias=` in the model to fix the validation to accept the underscores, and `serialize_by_alias=True` in the base model to fix the serialization. See: <https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/8700>

## Today I Learned (TIL)

Optional fields may appear only if the data is actually set.

- For example, when showing an account, the `display_name` field will only appear if the user has set a display name.
- Even for boolean fields: "not set if false"
  - but sometimes `false` appears in the output:
      http -b :8080/access/?project=All-Projects
        "config_visible": false,
- not set if range is empty (from 0 to 0) or not set
- not set for the All-Projects project

Input parameters will change the output, adding more data to the response.

Some endpoints require a query string, otherwise will return empty.

Some outputs require special permissions:

> <http://localhost:8080/Documentation/rest-api-plugins.html#list-plugins>
>
> To be allowed to see the installed plugins, a user must be a member of a group that is granted the 'View Plugins' capability or the 'Administrate Server' capability.

Some outputs require special compile options:

> <http://localhost:8080/Documentation/rest-api-documentation.html>
>
> Please note that this feature is only usable with documentation built-in. Youâ€™ll need to bazel build withdocs or bazel build release to test this feature.

## Gerrit versions

## Auth

Set an HTTP password in the UI for the `admin` user: <http://localhost:8080/settings/#HTTPCredentials>

Add it to `.netrc`:

```netrc
machine localhost login admin password ...
```

How to automate that?

## Calling API from the console

Install:

```bash
uv tool install httpie
```

Run without credentials (no `/a` prefix):

```console
$ http -b :8080/projects
)]}'
{
    "All-Projects": {
        "id": "All-Projects",
        "state": "ACTIVE",
        "web_links": [
            {
                "name": "browse",
                "url": "/plugins/gitiles/All-Projects"
            }
        ]
    },
    "All-Users": {
        "id": "All-Users",
        "state": "ACTIVE",
        "web_links": [
            {
                "name": "browse",
                "url": "/plugins/gitiles/All-Users"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Run with credentials (use the `/a` prefix):

```bash
http -b :8080/a/groups
```

With query parameters

```bash
http -b :8080/a/accounts suggest== q==a
```

To query some Gerrit installs, you must `--follow` redirects:

```bash
http --follow gerrit.example.com/a/groups
```

## Querying the changes endpoint

By default there's no changes to query, I must create a repo and submit a change.

```bash
git clone "<http://localhost:8080/test>" &&
(cd "test" &&
    mkdir -p `git rev-parse --git-dir`/hooks/ &&
    curl -Lo `git rev-parse --git-dir`/hooks/commit-msg <http://localhost:8080/tools/hooks/commit-msg> &&
    chmod +x `git rev-parse --git-dir`/hooks/commit-msg)

cd test/
echo foo > README.md
git add README.md
gcm First commit
git remote add gerrit <http://localhost:8080/test>
git review
```

## Python package

Have a single package, with the Gerrit versions as submodules:

```python
from pydantic_gerrit.v3_12.groups import GroupInfo
```

Users can also detect the actual Gerrit server version at runtime and load the correct submodule.

Should I divide the package by major endpoints (like Gerrit docs) or join all endpoints in a single module?

Use calver.org instead of semver? Semver because I may decide to change the package structure any time, and that's a breaking change.

Package name:

```python
import pydantic
import pydantic_settings
import pydantic_gerrit  # pydantic is "Data validation using Python type hints", just stating Gerrit should be enough
```

## Multiple Gerrit versions

Use symlinks in the model files to avoid repetition? This can get messy when changing a symlink source: it will reflect in multiple versions, maybe without noticing.

Tests? How to do it? Feature sniffing or completely separate per version?

No need to support patch-level versions. They are bugfixes and there's no functionality change:

- <https://www.gerritcodereview.com/3.11.html#bugfix-releases>
- <https://www.gerritcodereview.com/3.10.html#bugfix-releases>
- <https://www.gerritcodereview.com/3.9.html#bugfix-releases>

Will we support only the active (not EOL'ed) versions? If so, what happens when a version we support gets EOL'ed? Do we remove it from the package? Or just stop testing and updating it?

One idea is having a `latest` "version", where all the most current models will reside. Versioned packages will import from `latest` when there's no changes. Otherwise they must contain their own implementation for the differing models. For the user, one (questionable) advantage is being able to always import from `pydantic_gerrit.latest.*`, as long as they always use the most recent Gerrit version.

```python
from pydantic_gerrit.latest.groups import GroupInfo, GroupOptionsInfo
from pydantic_gerrit.latest.accounts import AccountInfo, AvatarInfo
```

Or maybe not having the `latest` namespace and allowing for direct endpoints access from the root package: `pydantic_gerrit.groups`.

```python
from pydantic_gerrit.groups import GroupInfo, GroupOptionsInfo
from pydantic_gerrit.accounts import AccountInfo, AvatarInfo
```

But this is all weird. The typing is always tied to a specific Gerrit version. The user must know which Gerrit version they are targeting.

```python
from pydantic_gerrit.v3_12.groups import GroupInfo, GroupOptionsInfo
from pydantic_gerrit.v3_12.accounts import AccountInfo, AvatarInfo
```

Maybe remove the underscore from the version? There won't be too many different numbers at any given time...

```python
from pydantic_gerrit.v312.groups import GroupInfo, GroupOptionsInfo
from pydantic_gerrit.v312.accounts import AccountInfo, AvatarInfo
```

If I only have versioned packages, how to organize the actual code? If a model is exactly the same in all Gerrit versions, under which specific version its implementation should reside? The older or the newer? Or in a private internal namespace? If it's in the older (the most intuitive), then it's a trouble when I need to remove a version (e.g., because it was EOL'ed). Well it's a one-time trouble.

Should I use `__all__` to make all models available?

## Additional ideas

- Publish schemas from the models, in the repository or <https://www.schemastore.org/>

- Document (or even publish) that one can convert Pydantic models to TypedDict: <https://github.com/unclecode/pydantype>.
  - Useful for those not using Pydantic models in their code, but still want to type the JSON results.

That means the documentation may be wrong, or not in sync with the code. That's why actual testing in a Gerrit instance is required.
